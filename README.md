# BookstoreAPI

## Introduction
*BookstoreAPI* is a RESTful service designed to manage a bookstore's inventory, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on books.

## Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Maven/Gradle (whichever you are using)
- H2 Database
- Postman for API testing

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using Maven/Gradle and set up the H2 database:

\`\`\`bash
$ mvn spring-boot:run
\`\`\`
or
\`\`\`bash
$ gradle bootRun
\`\`\`

Access the H2 Database console at `http://localhost:9090/h2-ui`

## Usage
Use Postman to interact with the API. Here you can add examples of how to send requests to your API, such as how to add a new book, retrieve all books, update book details, or delete a book.
